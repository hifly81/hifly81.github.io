      <description>City of stars Are you shining just for me? City of stars There&amp;rsquo;s so much that I can&amp;rsquo;t see Who knows? I felt it from the first embrace I shared with you That now our dreams They&amp;rsquo;ve finally come true
City of stars Just one thing everybody wants There in the bars And through the smokescreen of the crowded restaurants
It&amp;rsquo;s love Yes, all we&amp;rsquo;re looking for is love from someone else</description>

      <description>Warning [SPOILER ALERT]
I recently saw Ridley Scott&amp;rsquo;s new film, Napoleon, a short cinematic reconstruction of the rise and fall of Napoleon Bonaparte.
Napoleon is played by Joaquin Phoenix, an outstanding actor in every performance. Even if here in my opinion a little subdued.
The film retraces some of the most important battles of Bonaparte&amp;rsquo;s career and is centered on the love story with his Josephine. There are some scenes that are a little rough in my opinion, not worthy of Ridley Scott (the cannons against the Egyptian pyramids?</description>

      <description>Some days ago like every year, December 1st, was International AIDS Day.
The AIDS syndrome appeared forcefully in the 1980s and is still a very important and widespread disease today.
There is very little communication now on this topic but it is good to remember that 40 years later, medicine has made important progress and today people with the HIV virus live an almost normal life. Yes, because the HIV virus leads to AIDS syndrome only if patients do not adequately follow a therapeutic path and do not take drugs that contain the virus.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m sorry, but I don&amp;rsquo;t want to be an emperor That&amp;rsquo;s not my business I don&amp;rsquo;t want to rule or conquer anyone I should like to help everyone if possible Jew, Gentile, Black Man, White We all want to help one another, human beings are like that We want to live by each other&amp;rsquo;s happiness, not by each other&amp;rsquo;s misery We don&amp;rsquo;t want to hate and despise one another
And this world has room for everyone, and the good Earth is rich and can provide for everyone The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way Greed has posioned men&amp;rsquo;s souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in Machinery that gives us abundance has left us in want</description>
