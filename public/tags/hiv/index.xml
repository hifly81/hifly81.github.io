      <description>Some days like every year, December 1st was International AIDS Day.
The AIDS syndrome appeared forcefully in the 1980s and is still a very important and widespread disease today.
There is very little communication now on this topic but it is good to remember that 40 years later, medicine has made important progress and today people with the HIV virus live an almost normal life. Yes, because the HIV virus leads to AIDS syndrome only if patients do not adequately follow a therapeutic path and do not take drugs that contain the virus.</description>
