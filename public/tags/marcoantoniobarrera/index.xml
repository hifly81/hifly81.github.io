      <description>At the suggestion of a friend of mine, I saw a short documentary on the boxing career of Prince Naseem Hamed.
&amp;ldquo;Naz&amp;rdquo; was certainly one of the most influential boxers of the late 90s and early 2000s and one of the greatest featherweights in history. He had very powerful and precise strikes for a featherweight and an engaging, very show-oriented in-ring style.
I have always had the idea that his successful career was made possible by having to face weak opponents and by the need to create a character who could bring prestige to the minor categories of boxing.</description>
