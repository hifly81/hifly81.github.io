      <description>Val Gardena is a place the heart for me.

A unique Dolomite valley that is nestled between its 3 Ladin villages, Santa Cristina, Selva and Ortisei and where nature and mountains are at their best.
Today on the Saslong downhill ski slope, Dominique Paris, the most famous Italian downhill skier in alpine skiing, achieved a fabulous victory, 22 years after the last success of an Italian.</description>
