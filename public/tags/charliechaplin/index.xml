      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m sorry, but I don&amp;rsquo;t want to be an emperor That&amp;rsquo;s not my business I don&amp;rsquo;t want to rule or conquer anyone I should like to help everyone if possible Jew, Gentile, Black Man, White We all want to help one another, human beings are like that We want to live by each other&amp;rsquo;s happiness, not by each other&amp;rsquo;s misery We don&amp;rsquo;t want to hate and despise one another
And this world has room for everyone, and the good Earth is rich and can provide for everyone The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way Greed has posioned men&amp;rsquo;s souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in Machinery that gives us abundance has left us in want</description>
