I am a guy (and always will be in spirit) over 40 who works as a Solutions Architects in the IT sector.

I studied Computer Engineering and my background is humanistic and the subjects studied during my high school years have remained my passions as can be seen in this website.

In addition to literature, the study of history, art and music, I have a great passion for sport in general and mainly follow and practice mountain biking, trekking, tennis and basketball.

I am a fan of music, even if I don't always have a favorite genre, of cinema, but I don't like comedies and of theatre.

I love traveling and experiencing food from cuisines other than my own, the Italian one. I have many places in my heart, if I really had to indicate 3, I would say the islands of Greece, South Africa and the Dolomites.

I have two wonderful children who fill my days with joy, peace and hope.
