I am over 40, and I'm currently working as a Solutions Architects in the IT sector.

I studied Computer Engineering and my background is humanistic and the subjects studied during my high school years have remained my passions as can be seen in this website.

In addition to literature, the study of history, art and music, I have a great passion for sport in general and mainly follow and practice mountain biking, trekking, tennis, swimming and basketball.

I am a fan of music, especially progressive metal and grunge, and I also love watching movies.

I love traveling and experiencing food from cuisines other than my own, the Italian one. I have many places in my heart, if I really had to indicate 3, I would say the islands of Greece, South Africa and the Dolomites.

I believe very much in volunteering experiences, they should be a part of everyone's life.

My thoughts do not tolerate wars or borders between peoples. There is always time to help others.

_"Le vittime di una guerra, qualsiasi guerra, sono sempre i civili, che non hanno colpe. Ecco perché la guerra è sbagliata in sé"_ - Gino Strada
