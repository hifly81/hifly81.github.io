Warning [SPOILER ALERT]

I recently saw Ridley Scott's new film, Napoleon, a short cinematic reconstruction of the rise and fall of Napoleon Bonaparte.

Napoleon is played by Joaquin Phoenix, an outstanding actor in every performance. Even if here in my opinion a little subdued.

The film retraces some of the most important battles of Bonaparte's career and is centered on the love story with his Josephine.
There are some scenes that are a little rough in my opinion, not worthy of Ridley Scott (the cannons against the Egyptian pyramids?).

Ultimately the film flows quite tiredly, failing to involve us either in the plots relating to the battles or in the development of the poorly defined love story.
