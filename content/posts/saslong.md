Val Gardena is a place the heart for me. 

For many years now in summer it has been the place that means regeneration and peace for me and that I choose for my summer holidays.

A unique Dolomite valley that is nestled between its 3 Ladin villages, Santa Cristina, Selva and Ortisei and where nature and mountains are at their best.

Today on the Saslong downhill ski slope, Dominique Paris, the most famous Italian downhill skier in alpine skiing, achieved a fabulous victory, 22 years after the last success of an Italian.
On that slope which is the emblem of the Dolomites and which makes you fall in love with every step.
