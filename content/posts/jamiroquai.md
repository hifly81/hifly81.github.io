I know all the songs of two bands: The Beach Boys and Jamiroquai.

I grew up with the former's vinyl records at home and I have always found their music to be a work of art of virtuosity and creativity.
And then I discovered the music of Jamiroquai in my teenage years.

In many ways I have always compared them to The Beach Boys, for their musical experimentation, for the joy of their melodies. And for a feature that is unique to me: Jamiroquai's bass is unsurpassed. 

This is what I call _groove_, which often takes me to a sensorial dimension.

And like an evening in a sensorial restaurant, I propose here a sensorial journey with some of Jamiroquai's songs.

As an appetizer I would start with "Too Young To Die".

A first course to get into the atmosphere can only be "Space Cowboy".

The second course is clearly indicated with "Virtual Insanity", their most successful hit and the most representative of their music.

To end the session, the dessert can only be "Seven Days in a Sunny June". 

To end on a high note at the beginning of summer.
