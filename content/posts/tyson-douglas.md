My father was a great boxing fan and inevitably passed this passion on to me too.

I saw many matches with him before I was born, especially those of Monzon and Marvin "The Marvelous" Hagler.

In the second half of the 80s the heavyweight scene was monopolized by a boy from the suburbs of New York, who became the youngest heavyweight champion of the world, Mike "Iron" Tyson, by dint of instant KOs.

In February 1990 Mike Tyson had to defend the title in Tokyo against an American heavyweight, a decent boxer but generally considered an easy target for Mike, we are talking about James "Buster" Douglas.

I remember that night the live broadcast from Tokyo with commentary by Rino Tommasi; me and my father in the lounge to watch the match.

Tommasi defined Tyson's first defeat by knockout in the 10th round as the biggest surprise in boxing history.

After so many years I can still say with certainty that no one would have expected that epilogue.

From then on, Mike Tyson's career in boxing and beyond took the path of decline.
