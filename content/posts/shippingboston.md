Warning [SPOILER ALERT]

I'm a big fan of Martin Scorsese's films. 

In one of his masterpieces, The Departed, there is an amazing soundtrack, as usual. 

The very first scene with Matt Damon as a young man and his first meeting with Costello is described with the background of _Gimme Shelter by The Rolling Stones_, 
while the scene that officially opens the film, a sequence that shows the two sides of the story, the good and evil, played by a masterful Leonardo Di Caprio and Matt Damon, has _I'm shipping up to Boston by the Dropkick Murphys_ as its background.

Two wonderful scenes for a film that can only fascinate.
