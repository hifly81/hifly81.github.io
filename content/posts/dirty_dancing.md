Last night after many years I happened to see Dirty Dancing again, a film I think everyone knows.

The intensity of some scenes in this film are so current that seeing them again I was left speechless as always.
And the message of love without limits, impossible but then possible is a timeless classic.

It is also a tribute to a great actor like Patrick Swayze who always gave me the idea of being a person with kind and polite ways.
He left us very early but has remained an icon of all love stories since the 80s.

The soundtrack of the film is in line with the same emotion that the film wants to transmit, the most intense is certainly "Hungry Eyes" by Eric Carmen.
Happy listening:
