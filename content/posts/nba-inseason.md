A tournament within the already exhausting NBA season. 

It's called the NBA In-Season Tournament which this week will see the final round and the winner of the first edition. 

The prize will be a cash budget to be distributed to the various players and the new trophy, NBA Cup (a kind of National Cup?).

Luckily the matches of this new tournament will also be valid for the regular season.
