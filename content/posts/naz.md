At the suggestion of a friend of mine, I saw a short documentary on the boxing career of _Prince Naseem Hamed_. 

"Naz" was certainly one of the most influential boxers of the late 90s and early 2000s and one of the greatest featherweights in history. 
He had very powerful and precise strikes for a featherweight and an engaging, very show-oriented in-ring style. 

I have always had the idea that his successful career was made possible by having to face weak opponents and by the need to create a character who could bring prestige to the minor categories of boxing. 

It is not surprising that faced with his first notable contender, _Marco Antonio Barrera_, he suffered his first defeat in a match dominated by the Mexican who gave the idea of being a much, much more complete boxer.

After the defeat against Barrera, Naz's career practically ended, it was said due to the impossibility of boxing due to intense pain in his hands, but the thing remains quite mysterious.

However, a great boxer, perhaps a little constructed by the promoters but who left his mark.
